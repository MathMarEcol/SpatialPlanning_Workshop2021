# Acknowledgements

Many thanks to the [Prioritizr Team](https://prioritizr.net/articles/prioritizr.html) for the development of this software, and for providing the source code for their own workshops so we could more easily develop this one.

Also to Yihui Xie for developing the [bookdown R package](http://bookdown.org) that underpins these notes. We also thank Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham for creating one of the Rstudio screenshots used in this manual that was originally a part of their _R for Data Science_ book.
